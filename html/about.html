                Hello there! I'm Jordan, a self-motivated web developer who
                thrives on continuous learning and growth in the dynamic world
                of web development. I'm delighted to have you here on my profile
                to share my journey and showcase the skills I've cultivated
                through dedication and passion. Throughout my career, I've been
                driven by a relentless desire to improve and excel. As a
                self-learner, I embrace every opportunity to expand my knowledge
                and expertise. I make it a personal goal to learn something new
                every day, whether it's exploring cutting-edge frontend
                frameworks or diving into the intricacies of backend
                technologies. This commitment to constant improvement allows me
                to stay ahead of the curve and deliver innovative solutions to
                every project I undertake.

                To complement my thirst for knowledge, I also invest time daily
                in practicing and honing my existing skills. By dedicating
                myself to consistent practice, I can solidify my abilities and
                ensure that I perform at my best in any web development
                endeavor. From refining my coding prowess to mastering design
                principles, I believe that practice is the key to reaching new
                heights in this fast-paced industry.I take great pride in
                holding an Associate's degree from Full Sail University, which
                has provided me with a solid foundation in web development.
                However, my true passion lies in the real-world application of
                my skills and my drive to push the boundaries of what's possible
                in web design and development.
